# React Blog

Blogging has always been hard for me to get in to. I have never been great at expressing my thoughts through text. So I decided that I wanted to get over that feeling and just do it. I have always heard great things about writing down my thoughts. So I thought that I would finally give it a solid go. This website is my first attempt at blogging and getting into the internet world. I hope you all enjoy the site, and feel free to write your own down as well.
